# Production Readiness Checklist - Nimbus Extension

## ✅ Sign-In Flow

**Status: READY**

1. **Primary Method (Production)**: `getProfileUserInfo` - Works in Chrome Web Store
   - Gets email directly from Chrome if user is signed in
   - No OAuth popup needed
   - Caches email in storage

2. **Fallback Method**: `getAuthToken` with OAuth
   - Interactive OAuth flow if `getProfileUserInfo` fails
   - Fetches email from Google API

3. **Unpacked Mode Fallback**: Email input field
   - Only shows if both methods fail (unpacked mode testing)
   - Allows manual email entry for testing

**User Flow:**
- User clicks "Sign in with Google"
- Extension gets email automatically (if signed into Chrome)
- Email is saved and popup reloads
- "Subscribe" button becomes enabled

## ✅ Subscription Checking

**Status: READY - STRICT BLOCKING**

1. **Initial Load**: Popup checks subscription immediately
   - If not subscribed → Shows payment screen
   - Blocks ALL content until payment

2. **Content Script**: Blocks tooltip features
   - Shows subscribe prompt instead of definitions
   - No word lookups without subscription

3. **Verification Methods**:
   - Checks by `subscriptionId` first
   - Falls back to `userEmail` if no ID
   - Verifies with Stripe API
   - Checks expiry dates

4. **Storage**: 
   - Saves `subscriptionActive: true` when verified
   - Updates `subscriptionId` and `subscriptionExpiry`
   - Removes data if expired or invalid

## ✅ Payment Flow

**Status: READY**

1. **Checkout Creation**:
   - User clicks "Start Free Trial"
   - Creates Stripe checkout session
   - Opens in new tab

2. **Payment Completion**:
   - Background script detects Stripe redirect
   - Closes tab automatically
   - Verifies subscription via `/api/get-session`
   - Saves subscription data
   - Notifies extension to reload

3. **Polling Fallback**:
   - Polls every 5 seconds for up to 5 minutes
   - Checks by `sessionId` first (10 attempts)
   - Falls back to email verification
   - Activates subscription when found

4. **Manual Verification**:
   - "Already paid? Verify Subscription" button

   - Useful if polling fails

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Email Fallback**: The email input fallback is ONLY for unpacked mode testing. In production (Chrome Web Store), `getProfileUserInfo` should work automatically.

2. **Subscription Blocking**: The extension STRICTLY blocks all features until payment. No bypasses exist.

3. **Payment Activation**: Multiple methods ensure subscription activates:
   - Background script verification (immediate)
   - Polling mechanism (fallback)
   - Manual verification button (user-initiated)

4. **API Keys**: All API keys are stored on Vercel, not in the extension code.
