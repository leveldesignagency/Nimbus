# Push to GitHub - Next Steps

## Commands to Run

I've prepared everything. Now you need to push to GitHub:

```bash
cd /Users/charlesmorgan/Documents/CursorIQ
git push -u origin main
```

**Note**: If you get authentication errors, you may need to:
1. Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
2. Or use GitHub CLI: `gh auth login`

## After Pushing

1. Go to: https://github.com/leveldesignagency/Nimbus
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages** (left sidebar)
3. Under **Source**, select:
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Folder**: `/ (root)`
4. Click **Save**

Your privacy policy will be live at:
**https://leveldesignagency.github.io/Nimbus/**

## Once Privacy Policy is Live

Reply with: **"Privacy policy live at [URL]"**

Then I'll add it to manifest.json and we'll move to Step 3!
