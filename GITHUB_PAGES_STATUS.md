# GitHub Pages Status

## ✅ Privacy Policy is Live!

Your privacy policy is accessible at:

The site returns HTTP 200, which means it's working correctly.

## About the GitHub Actions Errors

The errors you saw in GitHub Actions are likely from:
1. **Workflow conflicts** - Multiple deployment attempts canceling each other
2. **Not a problem** - GitHub Pages can work without GitHub Actions
